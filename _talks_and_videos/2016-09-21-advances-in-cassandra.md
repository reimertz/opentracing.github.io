In this talk Mick Semb Wever, Consultant at The Last Pickle, will discuss the formation of the OpenTracing Project, its goals for making tracing ubiquitous, and its work improving the way Zipkin uses Apache Cassandra. He will present examples of tracing application requests through to Cassandra reading from disk, including Zipkin tracing its own operations.
