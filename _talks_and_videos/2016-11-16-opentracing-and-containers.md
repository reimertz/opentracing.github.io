Those building microservices at scale understand the role and importance of distributed tracing: itâ€™s the most direct way to understand how and why a system is misbehaving. But distributed tracing has long harbored a dirty secret: the source code instrumentation can been complex, fragile, expensive, and difficult to maintain.

The OpenTracing project addresses that integration problem through standardization and collaborations with other open-source software systems. In this talk, Ben will begin by describing OpenTracing and explaining why you should care about it. He will then show how OpenTracing will be able to deliver zero-touch, black-box instrumentation of distributed applications via orchestration systems like Kubernetes, and why that could change the way we all reason about distributed computation.
